# Radar
This is the repository for *Radar*, an Application of Project *Sycamore*.

The Application was developed by Tommy Crews for Dr. Jeremy Evert's Mobile Applications class in the Spring semester of 2017 at Southwestern Oklahoma State University.

*Radar* performs comprehensive network analysis and diagnostics, providing enough information for professional users while remaining simple enough for anyone to understand.

## Installation

To install *Radar*, you must be running macOS and have Xcode 8 installed. You also need CocoaPods, and you need to install from my podfile.

You'll probably have to play around with project configuration as well. You obviously can't use my Xcode workspace, or signing credentials.
